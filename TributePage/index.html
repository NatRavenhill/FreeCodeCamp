        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p>Agüero began his career at Independiente. On 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to debut in the Argentine Primera División at 15 years and 35 days, breaking the record previously established by Diego Maradona in 1976. In 2006, Agüero moved to Europe to play for La Liga side Atlético Madrid, for a transfer fee of €23 million. He made a name for himself, attracting attention from Europe's top clubs by scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances while winning the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010.</p>
        <p>Agüero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million. On the last day of his debut season with the club, Agüero scored a 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015–16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Agüero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes - beating Thierry Henry with a goal every 121.8 minutes. He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time. He is the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, and reached 100 goals in the division faster than any player other than Alan Shearer. On 1 November 2017, Aguero became Manchester City's all-time highest goal-scorer, scoring his 178th City goal against Napoli.<p>
        <p>At international level, Agüero represented the Argentina under-20 team at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2005 and in 2007, winning both tournaments. Agüero played at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, scoring two goals in the 3–0 semi-final win against Brazil as Argentina went on to win the gold medal. Agüero was selected to represent Argentina in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the 2011 Copa América, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América, and the Copa América Centenario, reaching the finals of the latter three tournaments.</p>

        <p>Having scored on Manchester City's opening fixture of the season against Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 August 2017,Agüero scored his second goal of the season against Liverpool in a 5–0 win on 9 September.

One week later, Agüero scored his sixth Premier League hat-trick in a 6–0 win at Watford to put Manchester City top of the league. On 28 September, Agüero was involved in a road accident after attending a Maluma concert in Amsterdam, when his taxi crashed into a lamppost. He was left with a fractured rib and ruled out for two weeks.</p>  
        <p>On 21 October, Agüero scored his 177th goal for Manchester City in a 3–0 win over Burnley, equalling the record set by Eric Brook. This was also the Citizens 11th straight win, equalling another club record. He scored his record 178th goal for the team on 1 November away at Napoli in a Champions League group game, a 4–2 win that sent his team through to the knockout stages of the competition.[180] On 20 January, Aguero scored his first hat-trick of the season against Newcastle in a 3-1 win, his second goal being the landmark 350th goal of his career. </p>
