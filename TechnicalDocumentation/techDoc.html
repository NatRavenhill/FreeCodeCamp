          JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
          implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
          more than just sit there and display static information for you to
          look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
          animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet
          that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the
          layer cake of standard web technologies
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give
            meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs,
            headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our
            HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and
            laying out our content in multiple columns.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create
            dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
            and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is
            amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple
        text label as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it
        structure and purpose:</p>

        <code><p>Player 1: Chris</p></code>

        <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>

        <code>p {
            font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
            letter-spacing: 1px;
            text-transform: uppercase;
            text-align: center;
            border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
            background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
            color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
            box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
            border-radius: 10px;
            padding: 3px 10px;
            display: inline-block;
            cursor: pointer;
          }</code>

          <p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behavior:</p>

          <code>const para = document.querySelector('p');

            para.addEventListener('click', updateName);
            
            function updateName() {
              let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
              para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
            }</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="WHAT_CAN_IT_DO?">
        <header>What can it do?</header>
        </p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.</li>
            <li>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".</li>
            <li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</li>
            <li>And much more!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There's a lot more available, too! However, don't get over excited just yet. You won't be able to build the next Facebook, Google Maps, or Instagram after studying JavaScript for 24 hours — there are a lot of basics to cover first. And that's why you're here — let's move on!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="WHAT_IS_IT_DOING_ON_YOUR_PAGE?">
        <header>What is it doing on your page?</header>

        <p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. If the JavaScript loads and tries to run before the HTML and CSS it is affecting has been loaded, errors can occur.</p>

        <p>When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HOW_DO_YOU_ADD_IT_TO_YOUR_PAGE?">
        <header>How do you add it to your page?</header>

        <p>JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses link elements to apply external stylesheets and style elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the script element. Let's learn how this works.</p>

        <p>
            First of all, make a local copy of our example file apply-javascript.html. Save it in a directory somewhere sensible. Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page containing a clickable button. Next, go to your text editor and add the following in your head — just before your closing head tag:
        </p>

        <code>
            <script>
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
                function createParagraph() {
                  let para = document.createElement('p');
                  para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
                  document.body.appendChild(para);
                }
              
                const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');
              
                for(let i = 0; i < buttons.length ; i++) {
                  buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
                }
              });
              </script>
        </code>

        <p>Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button, a new paragraph is generated and placed below.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="COMMENTS">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be ignored by the browser, and exist to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works (and you, if you come back to your code after six months and can't remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and you should use them often, particularly for larger applications. There are two types:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (//), e.g</p>
                <code>
                    // I am a comment
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */, e.g.</p>
                <code>
                    /*
            I am also
            a comment
          */
                </code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>So for example, we could annotate our last demo's JavaScript with comments like so:</p>

        <code>
            // Function: creates a new paragraph and appends it to the bottom of the HTML body.

function createParagraph() {
  let para = document.createElement('p');
  para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
  document.body.appendChild(para);
}

/*
  1. Get references to all the buttons on the page in an array format.
  2. Loop through all the buttons and add a click event listener to each one.

  When any button is pressed, the createParagraph() function will be run.
*/

const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length ; i++) {
  buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
}
        </code>
      </section>
